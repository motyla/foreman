Generally, you need the following things installed:

* Puppet
* rake >= 0.84

to get latest working branch (which is the only one really valid at this point of time do:

git clone git://github.com/ohadlevy/gni.git gni
cd gni
git checkout -b origin/ohad
git submodule update --init

if you want to share the database with Puppets (storeconfig) edit config/database.yml and configure the production database to point to the same database, if not, you can use any other database rails support.

type:
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
./script/server -e production

the following URLs might be intersting:
http://localhost:3000/ for really basic webgui
http://localhost:3000/unattended/kickstart will return a kickstart file for the relevant machine
http://localhost:3000/hosts/externalNodes?fqdn=<host fqdn> will retun a yaml output for puppet to use.
